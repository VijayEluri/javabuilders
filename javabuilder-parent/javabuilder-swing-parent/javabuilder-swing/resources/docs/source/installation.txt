Installation
============

Standard
--------

Start off with downloading the latest Swing JavaBuilder ZIP file distribution off the JavaBuilders.org
website.
 
In the root folder you will find the Swing JavaBuilder jar and in the /lib folder you will find all of its
dependencies. Add all of them to your project's classpath.
 
In the /samples folder you will find a sample application that you can use to get a better understanding of
how you can build complex user interfaces using this library.

Maven
-----
