Preface
=======

In 2007 or so, Sun Microsystems announced their JavaFX project, which aimed to deliver declarative UIs
and rich desktop functionality. Unfortunately, in what I've always believed to be a severely misguided
decision, this was accomplished by introducing a totally new language, instead of enhancing the core
Java abilities and the existing Swing UI toolkit.

I decided that there had to be a middle-of-the-road approach that could give Java UI developers the
productivity of declarative UIs without the need to throw out their current language skills out and focus on
an unproved and untested new language (whose features I wasn't particularly fond of anyway, but that's
a different story).

The JavaBuilders project was a result of this desire. It started off with many weeks of research and
evaluation of different options. This resulted finally in the creation of a generic declarative UI based
around the YAML format (which has many advantages over the XML or JSON formats) and the
integration of many leading open source libraries (for features such as databinding or input validation)
into one integrated solution.

The Swing JavaBuilder is the first production-ready implementation of the JavaBuilder engine, but it's
generic nature allows it to be configured for other UI toolkits as well. In the future a SWT JavaBuilder is
planned (and maybe even GTK+ and Qt versions as well).

I hope its adoption by you and your team will greatly increase your productivity and ensure a long and
healthy future for Java rich client development.
